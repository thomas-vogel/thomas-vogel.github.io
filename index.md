Thomas is a postdoctoral researcher in the [Software Engineering Group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/se){:target="_blank"} at the [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en){:target="_blank"}. From 10/2021 to 09/2022, he was [stand-in professor for Empirical Software Engineering at Paderborn University](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/person/92621){:target="_blank"}. Previously, he was a doctoral student in the [System Analysis and Modeling Group](https://hpi.de/en/giese/){:target="_blank"} at the [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de/en.html){:target="_blank"} at [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/index.html){:target="_blank"}, where he received his [Ph.D.](publications/phd) degree with summa cum laude in 2018.
He studied Information Systems and graduated with distinction from the [University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/){:target="_blank"}.
His research interests are in the areas of (search-based and model-driven) software engineering, self-adaptive & intelligent/autonomous systems, and automated quality assurance of software as well as the combination of these areas.


## Note (Jan 2024)

I am on parental leave from January to August 2024.

During this time, I am not available for service such as reviews. I am not teaching and won't be accepting new students for bachelor's or master's theses.
