## Things Happening

* __Apr 2022__ --- The summer semester is starting and I will offer a lecture on _Software Quality Assurance_ and two seminars, one on _Learning, Optimization, and Assurances for Self-Adaptive Systems_ and one on _Search-Based Software Engineering_. See my [teaching page](teaching) for details.
* __Mar 2022__ --- I joined the PC of the [_New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track_](https://conf.researchr.org/track/ase-2022/ase-2022-nier-track){:target="_blank"} of the [_37th International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2022)_](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2022){:target="_blank"}. Consider submitting your new ideas and emerging results on automated software engineering.
* __Feb 2022__ --- I joined the PC of the [3rd International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing	Systems (ACSOS 2022)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/acsos-2022){:target="_blank"}. Consider submitting your research results on self-adaptive systems.
* __Jan 2022__ --- Happy to receive a _2021 Best Reviewer Award_ of the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling ([SoSyM](https://www.sosym.org/reviewer_awards/){:target="_blank"}). I am among the "Top 1% of SoSyM Reviewers" for 2021.
