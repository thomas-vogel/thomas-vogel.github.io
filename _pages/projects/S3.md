Sapienz is a search-based test suite generation tool for mobile applications. The core idea and goal of this project is to achieve a _Self-Adaptive Search for Sapienz (S3)_, that is, the dynamic adaptation of Sapienz' search strategy in response to feedback obtained from analyzing the fitness landscape for each app while generating the test suite and testing the app. To realize S3, we transfer self-adaptation principles such as the Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE) adaptation loop to the search process of Sapienz. We envision better results in terms of fitness and especially for fault revelation taking the characteristics of the fitness landscape and thus the specific app under test into account.

For further details, please have a look at the following presentation held at the _Fall 2019 HPI Future SOC Lab Day_: [Search-Based App Testing, Fitness Landscape Analysis, and Diversity](https://www.tele-task.de/lecture/video/7788/){:target="_blank"}
