## As Principal Investigator

### Controlling Search-Based Test Case Generation and Program Repair
Dynamically controlling search processes to improve automated test case generation and program repair using control and self-adaptation principles (funded by DFG, [project website](projects/flash2)).

### Self-Adaptive Search for Sapienz
Transferring self-adaptation principles to the search process of Sapienz, a search-based test suite generation tool for mobile applications (funded by the 2018 Facebook Testing and Verification Research Award). For further details, please have a look at the following presentation: [Search-Based App Testing, Fitness Landscape Analysis, and Diversity](https://www.tele-task.de/lecture/video/7788/){:target="_blank"}.

## As Research Assistant

### FONDA -- Foundations of Workflows for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis
As part of the [DFG Collaborative Research Center 1404 "FONDA -- Foundations of Workflows for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis"](https://fonda.hu-berlin.de/){:target="_blank"}, I contribute to two subprojects:
* **Deriving Trust Levels for Multi-Choice Data Analysis Workflows:** The goal of this subproject is to improve the dependability of data analysis workflows in computational materials science by sampling configurations of such workflows and testing based on the NOMAD repository.
* **Distributed Run-Time Monitoring and Control of Data Analysis Workflows:** The goal of this subproject is to improve the dependability of data analysis workflows by monitoring and controlling such workflows at run-time.

### FLASH: Fitness landscape analysis to improve search-based software engineering
Analyzing and understanding the search space and search methods for software engineering problems to improve state-of-the-art search
heuristics to solve these problems
(funded by DFG, [project website](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/se/research/ongoingprojects/flash){:target="_blank"}).

### Specification and Verification of Requirements and Safety Contracts
Developing a domain-specific language for specifying and verifying requirements and safety contracts in the
automotive industry, and techniques for explaining counter examples of the verification process (in cooperation with BOSCH Research).

### Safe.Spec: Quality Assurance for Requirements Specifications
Developing a user-friendly, model-driven approach to specify, compose, and verify scenario-based requirements. This includes the pattern-based specification of scenarios using sequence diagrams, composing scenarios to automaton-based specifications, and integrating natural language-based property specification patterns with UPPAAL. (in cooperation with TWT GmbH, funded by BMBF, [project website](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/se/research/ongoingprojects/safespec){:target="_blank"}).

## Ph.D. Projects

### EUREMA: Executable Runtime Megamodels
A model-driven engineering approach to specify, execute, adapt, and evolve feedback loops in self-adaptive software systems ([project website](https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/giese/public/mdelab/mdelab-projects/software-engineering-for-self-adaptive-systems/eurema/){:target="_blank"}).

### MORISIA: Models at Runtime for Self-Adaptive Software
Researching runtime models for feedback loops in self-adaptive software systems to realize self-awareness and self-adaptation ([project website](https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/giese/public/mdelab/mdelab-projects/software-engineering-for-self-adaptive-systems/morisia/){:target="_blank"}).

### mRUBiS: modular Rice University Bidding System
An exemplar for model-based architectural self-healing and self-optimization of an information system. See [paper](publications/2018-SEAMSa) and [artifact at GitHub](https://github.com/thomas-vogel/mRUBiS){:target="_blank"}.
