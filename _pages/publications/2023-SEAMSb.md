## Abstract
Despite the vast body of knowledge developed by the self-adaptive systems community and the wide use of self-adaptation in industry, it is unclear whether or to what extent industry leverages output of academics. Hence, it is important for the research community to answer the question: _Are the solutions developed by the self-adaptive systems community mature enough for industrial adoption?_ Leveraging a set of empirically-grounded guidelines for industry-relevant artifacts in self-adaptation, we develop a position to answer this question from the angle of using artifacts for evaluating research results in self-adaptation, which is actively stimulated and applied by the community.
