## Abstract
The 29th workshop on Concurrency, Specification, and Programming 2021 (CS&P'21) is one of a series of seminars formerly organised every even year by Humboldt University of Berlin and every odd year by Warsaw University. It deals with formal specification of concurrent and parallel systems, mathematical models for describing such systems, and programming and verification concepts for their implementation. The workshop has a tradition dating back to the mid-seventies; since 1993 it was named CS&P.
