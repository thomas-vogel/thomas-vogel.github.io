## Abstract
This book presents novel approaches to the formal specification of concurrent and parallel systems, mathematical models for describing such systems, and programming and verification concepts for their implementation. A special emphasis is on methods based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Chapters are revised selected papers from the 29th International Workshop on Concurrency, Specification, and Programming (CS&P 2021), Berlin, Germany. Nine independent chapters cover formal approaches to topics such as requirements formalization, parsing, or granular computing, as well as their applications in recommender systems, decision making, security, optimization, and other areas. The book thus addresses both researchers and practitioners in its field.
